 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
 This work consists of modelling non-linear systems through the use of Volterra Series and the creation of signals to extract the kernels of Volterra Series from the device under test to apply in a Hammerstein Model. Tube guitar amps has unique characteristics on processing sounds that differentiate from the sound of transistorized amps. The main objective of this work is to reproduce these unique characterists in an virtual model.
 
 Complementing a previous work in comparing different techniques of non-linear modelling, a methodology was developed to build a virtual model and compare to the real tube amp.
